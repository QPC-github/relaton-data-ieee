abstract:
- content: Mechanical characteristics of conduction-cooled versions of Eurocard-based
    circuit card assemblies are described. This specification is applicable to, but
    not limited to, the VMEbus standard, an internal interconnect (backplane) bus
    intended for connecting processing elements to their immediate fundamental resources.
    The aim is to ensure mechanical interchangeability of conduction-cooled circuit
    card assemblies in a format suitable for military and rugged applications and
    to ensure their compatibility with commercial, double-height 16 mm, Eurocard chassis.
