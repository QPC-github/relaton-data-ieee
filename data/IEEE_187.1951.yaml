abstract:
- content: Modern broadcast radio receivers of the super-heterodyne type are frequently
    sources of spurious radiation from the local oscillator, which radiation may cause
    severe interference with other services. In addition, in the case of television
    broadcast receivers, there may be radiation of power from other sources beside
    the local oscillator. This Standard describes the potential sources of spurious
    radiation from frequency modulation and television broadcast receivers and sets
    up methods of measurement whereby the strength of some of these radiations may
    be determined. Where the method for the two classes of receivers differ, the specifications
    for each are outlined
