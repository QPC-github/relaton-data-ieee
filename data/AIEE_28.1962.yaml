abstract:
- content: The current issue of this Standard is a revision of the previous issue
    C62.1-1957 to change many of the definitions, to add a new definition titled "Virtual
    Duration of Wave Front" which changes the method of measuring time to crest value,
    to eliminate the word "type" from arrester classification designations as superfluous,
    to add a 10 kv distribution arrester and 90 kv intermediate and station arresters
    to the list of standard ratings, to change the standard ratings above 90 kv to
    multiples of 3, 6, and 12 kv, and to make many editorial changes for purposes
    of clarification or conciseness.
