abstract:
  content: These criteria established minimum requirements for the safety-related
    functional performance and reliability of protection systems for stationary land-based
    nuclear reactors producing steam for electric power generation. Fulfillment of
    these requirements does not necessarily fully establish the adequacy of protective
    system functional performance and reliability. On the other hand, omission of
    any of these requirements will, in most instances, be an indication of system
    inadequacy. For purposes of these criteria, the nuclear power generating station
    protection system encompasses all electric and mechanical devices and circuitry
    (from sensors to actuation device input terminals) involved in generating those
    signals associated with the protective function. These signals include those that
    actuate reactor trip and that, in the event of a serious reactor accident, actuate
    engineered safeguards such as containment isolation, core spray, safety injection,
    pressure reduction, and air cleaning.
