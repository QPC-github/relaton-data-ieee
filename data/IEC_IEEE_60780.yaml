abstract:
  content: This International Standard describes the basic requirements for qualifying
    Class 1E electrical equipment important to safety and interfaces (electrical and
    mechanical) that are to be used in nuclear power generating stations facilities.
    The principles, methods, and procedures described are intended to be used for
    qualifying equipment, maintaining and extending qualification, and updating qualification,
    as required, if the equipment is modified. The qualification requirements in this
    standard, when met, demonstrate and document the ability of equipment to perform
    safety function(s) under applicable service conditions, including design basis
    events and reducing certain design extension conditions, and reduce the risk of
    environmentally induced common-cause equipment failure.
