abstract:
- content: This standard provides recommendations for the selection of instrumentation
    specific to the continuous monitoring and quantification of radioactivity in effluents
    released to the environment. The effluent streams considered may contain radioactive
    gases, liquids, particulates, or dissolved solids singly or in combination. This
    standard specifies detection capabilities, physical and operating limits, reliability,
    and calibration requirements and sets forth minimum performance requirements for
    effluent monitoring instrumentation. Unless otherwise specified, the criteria
    herein refer to the total system. This standard applies only to monitoring during
    routine operation that includes abnormal releases.<<ETX>>
