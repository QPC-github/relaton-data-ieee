abstract:
- content: The fundamentals of reliability analysis as it applies to the planning
    and design of industrial and commercial electric power distribution systems are
    presented. Included are basic concepts of reliability analysis by probability
    methods, fundamentals of power system reliability evaluation, economic evaluation
    of reliability, cost of power outage data, equipment reliability data, and examples
    of reliability analysis. Emergency and standby power, electrical preventive maintenance,
    and evaluating and improving reliability of the existing plant are also addressed.
    The presentation is self-contained and should enable trade-off studies during
    the design of industrial and commercial power systems. Design, installation, maintenance
    practices for electrical power and grounding (including both power-related and
    signal-related noise control) of sensitive electronic processing equipment used
    in commercial and industrial applications are presented.

- content: 'The objective of this book is to present the fundamentals of reliability
    analysis applied to the planning and design of industrial and commercial electric
    power distribution systems. The intended audience for this material is primarily
    consulting engineers and plant electrical engineers and technicians. The design
    of reliable industrial and commercial power distribution systems is important
    because of the high cost associated with power outages. It is necessary to consider
    the cost of power outages when making design decisions for new power distribution
    systems as well as to have the ability to make quantitative “cost-versus-reliability”
    trade-off studies. The lack of credible data concerning equipment reliability
    and the cost of power outages has hindered engineers in making such studies. This
    edition of the IEEE Std 493 overcomes these obstacles. Remarks: Revision of IEEE
    Std 493-1997'
