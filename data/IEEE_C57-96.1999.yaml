abstract:
  content: Reaffirmed 2004. General recommendations for the loading of dry-type distribution
    and power transformers that have 80 &#176;C, 115 &#176;C, and 150 &#176;C average
    winding rises and insulation systems limited to 150 &#176;C, 180 &#176;C, and
    220 &#176;C maximum hottest-spot operating temperatures, respectively, are covered
    in this guide. Recommendations for ventilated, nonventilated, and sealed dry-type
    transformers having impregnated insulation systems are included.
