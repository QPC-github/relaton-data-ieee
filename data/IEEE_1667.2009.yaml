abstract:
- content: A method for host authentication of removable storage devices and an optional
    method for authentication of hosts by removable storage devices are specified
    by this standard. Both methods are certificate based and manageable by device
    owners. In addition, a method for identifying non-storage capabilities of removable
    storage devices is specified.

- content: This project defines a standard protocol for secure authentication and
    creation of trust between a secure host and a directly attached Transient and
    other Storage Devices, such as a USB flash drive, portable hard drive, or cellular
    phone. The protocol has only an indirect relationship with data integrity/security,
    and does not directly address issues of authorization and enforcement. The protocol
    also does not address devices that are attached using a network connection. However,
    a device that uses a point-to-point wireless connection such as WUSB may comply
    with this protocol.
