abstract:
  content: Guidance for the application of ac high-voltage circuit breakers for shunt
    reactor switching is provided. Overvoltage generation for the three cases of directly
    grounded, ungrounded, and neutral reactor grounded shunt reactors is addressed
    in terms of derivation and limitation methods. Circuit breaker specification for
    the purpose and the use of laboratory test results to predict field performance
    is also covered by this guide.
