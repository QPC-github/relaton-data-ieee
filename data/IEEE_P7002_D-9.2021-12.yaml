abstract:
- content: The requirements for a systems/software engineering process for privacy-oriented
    considerations regarding products, services, and systems utilizing employee, customer,
    or other external user's personal data are defined by this standard. Organizations
    and projects that are developing and deploying products, systems, processes, and
    applications that involve personal information are candidate users of the P7002
    standard. Specific procedures, diagrams, and checklists are provided for users
    of the P7002 standard to perform conformity assessments on their specific privacy
    practices. Privacy impact assessments (PIAs) are described as a tool for both
    identifying where privacy controls and measures are needed and for confirming
    they are in place.
