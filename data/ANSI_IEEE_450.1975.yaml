abstract:
  content: Large stationary lead storage batteries play an ever increasing role in
    substation and generating station control systems and in providing the backup
    energy for emergencies. A definite need exists within the industry for an application
    guide and testing procedure to provide a common or standard method for selecting,
    applying, and installing batteries to meet station requirements. However, to provide
    a guide that can be used for determining the available capacity of the battery
    (especially for nuclear stations), this document will limit its scope to recommended
    practice for lead storage battery maintenance, testing. and replacement.
