abstract:
  content: Superseded by IEEE Std C37.102-2006 A review of the generally accepted
    forms of relay protection for the synchronous generator and its excitation system
    is presented. This guide is primarily concerned with protection against faults
    and abnormal operating conditions for large hydraulic, steam and conbustion-turbine
    generators.
