abstract:
  content: The purpose of this ANSI/IEEE proposed recommended practice is to give
    a common basis of comparison among electronic voltmeters offered for general purpose
    applications. It is recommended that all manufacturers offering instruments for
    general applications supply the information outlined. For the purpose of these
    specifications, general-purpose voltmeters do not include instruments which are
    primarily intended for measurement of pulses or similar discontinuous waveforms,
    or instruments of the electrometer type which are designed to provide an extremely
    high input resistance (10/sup 10/ ohms or more). It is recognized that additional
    information should be supplied with instruments in these and other special groups
    which manufacturers should not be asked to supply when they are offering instruments
    for more general applications.<<ETX>>
