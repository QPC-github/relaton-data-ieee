abstract:
- content: Low-voltage power circuit breakers that are intended for use in field circuits
    of apparatus such as generators, motors, synchronous condensers, or exciters,
    and that embody contacts for establishing field discharge circuits are covered.
    Service conditions, ratings, and functional components are discussed. Temperature
    limitations and classification of insulating materials, insulation (dielectric)
    withstand voltage requirements, and test requirements are addressed. An application
    guide is included.
