abstract:
- content: This standard specifies procedures, managed objects and protocols for bridges
    and end systems that provide identification and replication of packets for redundant
    transmission, identification of duplicate packets, and elimination of duplicate
    packets. It is not concerned with the creation of the multiple paths over which
    the duplicates are transmitted.
