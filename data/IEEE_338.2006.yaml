abstract:
- content: The standard provides criteria for the performance of periodic testing
    of nuclear power generating station safety systems. The scope of periodic testing
    consists of functional tests and checks, calibration verification, and time response
    measurements, as required, to verify that the safety system performs its defined
    safety function. Post-maintenance and post-modification testing are not covered
    by this document. This standard amplifies the periodic testing requirements of
    other nuclear safety-related IEEE standards.
