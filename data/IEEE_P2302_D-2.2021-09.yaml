abstract:
  content: This standard defines a functional model for federation based on the NIST
    Cloud Federation Reference Architecture. This model allows a range of deployment
    topologies and governance. As a general federation model, it can be applied to
    many application domains using different implementation approaches. As such, it
    includes cloud-to-cloud federation and interoperability.
