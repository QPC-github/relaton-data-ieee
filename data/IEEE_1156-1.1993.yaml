abstract:
- content: Fundamental information on minimum environmental withstand conditions is
    provided. The information is intended to be used in those cases in which a generic
    or detail specification for a certain module has been prepared. The intent is
    to achieve uniformity and reproducibility in the test conditions for all modules
    that may make up larger systems and are purported to have a rated environmental
    performance level. The specifications pertain to both the natural and artificial
    environments to which modules may be exposed. These conditions include, but are
    not limited to, thermal, mechanical, electrical, and atmospheric stresses.
