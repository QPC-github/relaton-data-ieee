abstract:
- content: Superseded by IEEE Std 776-1992. The inductive environment that exists
    in the vicinity of electric power and wire-line telecommunications systems and
    the interfering effects that may be produced are addressed. An interface that
    permits either party, without need to involve the other, to verify the induction
    at the interface by use of a probe wire is presented. This recommended practice
    does not apply to railway signal circuits.
