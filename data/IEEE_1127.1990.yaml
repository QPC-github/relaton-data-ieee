abstract:
- content: More and more substations are becoming necessary, due to the ever increasing
    load growth being evidenced by most electric utility companies and the requirement
    to keep pace with the demands for additional distribution facilities. This guide
    documents significant environmental items to be considered during the design phase,
    the construction period, and the operation of safe and reliable substations for
    community acceptance.<<ETX>>
