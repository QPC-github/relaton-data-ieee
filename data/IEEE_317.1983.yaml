abstract:
  content: Requirements for the design, construction, qualification, testing, and
    installation of electric penetration assemblies in nuclear containment structures
    for stationary nuclear power generating stations are presented. Quality control
    and quality assurance requirements, and requirements for purchaser's specification
    are included. The requirements for external circuits that connect to penetration
    assemblies and for operation, maintenance, or periodic testing after installation
    are not covered.
