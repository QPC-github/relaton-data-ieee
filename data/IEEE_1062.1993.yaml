abstract:
  content: Superseded by 1062-1998. A set of useful quality practices that can be
    selected and applied during one or more steps in a software acquisition process
    is described. This recommended practice can be applied to software that runs on
    any computer system regardless of the size, complexity, or criticality of the
    software, but is more suited for use on modified-off-the-shelf software and fully
    developed software.
