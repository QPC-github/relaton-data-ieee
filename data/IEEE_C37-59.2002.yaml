abstract:
- content: Directions and requirements are provided for the conversion of qualified
    power switchgear equipment. Examples such as low-voltage power circuit breakers;
    high-voltage outdoor and medium-voltage indoor drawout power circuit breakers;
    low- and medium-voltage fused contactors; low- and medium-voltage ground and test
    devices; medium-voltage fused load interrupter switches; and all metal-enclosed
    switchgear are covered. Existing design standards are referenced with appropriate
    guidance on design testing necessary to design-verify the conversions.
