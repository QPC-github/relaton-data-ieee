abstract:
  content: Replaces IEEE Std 1603-2003. ALF is a modeling language for library elements
    used in IC technology. ALF enables description of electrical, functional, and
    physical models in a formal language suitable for electronic design automation
    (EDA) application tools targeted for design and analysis of an IC. This standard
    provides rules that describe ALF and how tool developers, integrators, library
    creators, and library users should use it.
