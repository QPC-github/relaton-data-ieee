abstract:
- content: The synchronizing input and the data output for phasor measurements made
    by substation computer systems is discussed. Processes involved in computing phasors
    from sampled data, data-to-phasor conversions, and formats for timing imputs and
    phasor data output from a Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) are also addressed.
