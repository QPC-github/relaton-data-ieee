abstract:
  content: A protocol and methodology for software developers, computer vendors, and
    printer manufacturers to facilitate the orderly exchange of information between
    printers and host computers are defined in this standard. A minimum set of functions
    that permit meaningful data exchange is provided. Thus a foundation is established
    upon which compatible applications, computers, and printers can be developed,
    without compromising an individual organization's desire for design innovation.
