abstract:
- content: Accelerated aging tests on extruded medium-voltage cables using water-filled
    tanks are addressed. Information on the equipment, cable samples, test conditions,
    and measurements to perform the aging tests is provided. Techniques on how to
    analyze the test data are also included. The implementation of this guide will
    allow a better description of the test data obtained by different laboratories.

- content: This guide provides information on the equipment, cable specimens, test
    conditions, and measurements to perform accelerated aging tests on medium-voltage
    cables using water-filled tanks, whether the test be a time to failure test or
    a test in which samples are aged for fixed times followed by a diagnostic test
    such as a step ac breakdown test. The guide identifies the critical test parameters
    and describes techniques for their measurement and control. The implementation
    of the techniques will facilitate a comparison of data obtained by different laboratories.
