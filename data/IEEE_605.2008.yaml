abstract:
- content: A proper design of the substation bus ensures a safe and reliable operation
    of the substation and the power system. Two different types of buses are used
    in substations, the rigid bus and the strain (cable). This guide provides information
    on the different bus arrangements used in substations stating the advantages and
    disadvantages of each. Also it provides information as related to each bus type
    and construction. Once the bus type is selected, this guide provides the calculation
    tools for each bus type. Based on these calculations, the engineer can specify
    the bus size, forces acting on the bus structure, number of mounting structures
    required, and hardware requirements.
