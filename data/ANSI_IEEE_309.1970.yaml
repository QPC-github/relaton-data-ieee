abstract:
  content: This publication presents standard test procedures for Geiger-Muller counter
    radiation detectors. These detectors, originally announced by ?Geiger and Muller
    in 1928, represented a major step forward in the detection and counting of individual
    radioactive events. Standard test procedures are desirable so that measurements
    may have the same meaning to all manufacturers and users.
