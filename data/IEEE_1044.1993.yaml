abstract:
- content: A uniform approach to the classification of anomalies found in software
    and its documentation is provided. The processing of anomalies discovered during
    any software life cycle phase are described, and comprehensive lists of software
    anomaly classifications and related data items that are helpful to identify and
    track anomalies are provided. This standard is not intended to define procedural
    or format requirements for using the classification scheme. It does identify some
    classification measures and does not attempt to define all the data supporting
    the analysis of an anomaly.
