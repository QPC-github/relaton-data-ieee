abstract:
- content: This standard guides manufacturers/suppliers in planning and implementing
    the controls for the design and manufacture of lithium-ion (Li-ion) and lithium-ion
    polymer (Li-ion polymer) rechargeable battery packs used for multi-cell mobile
    computing devices. The provisions of this standard work together to define approaches
    to design, test, and evaluate a cell, battery pack, and host device to mitigate
    battery system failure. Additionally, this standard provides recommendations for
    end-user education and communication materials. This approach recommends the interfaces
    between subsystems (for example, cell, battery pack, host device, power adapter,
    etc.), and end users are as important to system reliability as is robust subsystem
    design and testing. This standard, therefore, includes subsystem interface design
    responsibilities for each subsystem manufacturer/supplier, and it provides messaging
    and communication provisions for end-user awareness. Therefore, the responsibility
    for total system reliability is shared between the designers/manufacturers/suppliers
    of the subsystems and the end user. Compliance to this standard requires adherence
    to all the provisions of the standard.

- content: 'This standard establishes criteria for design analysis for qualification,
    quality, and reliability of rechargeable battery systems for multi-cell mobile
    computing devices. It also provides methods for quantifying the operational performance
    of these batteries and their associated management and control systems including
    considerations for end-user notification. This standard covers rechargeable battery
    systems for mobile computing. The battery technologies covered are limited to
    Li-ion and Li-ion polymer, but future versions of this standard may include technologies
    that are not in general use at present. Also included are: battery pack electrical
    and mechanical construction; system, pack, and cell level charge and discharge
    controls; and battery status communications. The following are addressed: qualification
    process; manufacturing process control; energy capacity and demand management;
    levels of management and control in the battery systems; and current and planned
    lithium-based battery chemistries, packaging technologies, and considerations
    for end-user notification.'
