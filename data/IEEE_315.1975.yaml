abstract:
- content: A list of graphic symbols and class designation letters for use on electrical
    and electronics diagrams is provided. All of the symbols are designed so that
    their connection points fall on a modular grid, to help those who use a grid basis
    for the preparation of diagrams. A substantial effort has been made to make this
    standard compatible with approved International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)
    Recommendations (IEC Publication 117, in various parts).
