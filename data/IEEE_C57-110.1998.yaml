abstract:
- content: Methods are developed to conservatively evaluate the feasibility of supplying
    additional nonsinusoidal load currents from an existing installed dry-type or
    liquid-filled transformer, as a portion of the total load. Clarification of the
    necessary application information is provided to assist in properly specifying
    a new transformer expected to carry a load, a portion of which is composed of
    nonsinusoidal load currents. A number of examples illustrating these methods and
    calculations are presented. Reference annexes make a comparison of the document
    calculations to calculations found in other industry standards and suggested temperature
    rise methods are detailed for reference purposes.
