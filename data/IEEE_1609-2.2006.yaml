abstract:
- content: Secure message formats, and the processing of those secure messages, within
    the DSRC/WAVE system are defined. The standard covers methods for securing WAVE
    management messages and application messages, with the exception of vehicle-originating
    safety messages. It also describes administrative functions necessary to support
    the core security functions.
