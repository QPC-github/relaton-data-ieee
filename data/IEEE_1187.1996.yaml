abstract:
- content: Superseded by 1187-2002. Recommended design practices and procedures for
    storage, location, mounting, ventilation, instrumentation, preassembly, assembly,
    and charging of valve-regulated lead-acid (VRLA) storage batteries are provided.
    Recommended safety practices are also included. This recommended practice applies
    to all VRLA battery stationary installations.
