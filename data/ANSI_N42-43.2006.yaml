abstract:
- content: The operational and performance requirements for transportable and/or mobile
    radiation monitors used in homeland security applications are specified in this
    standard. Transportable radiation monitors are designed to be transported to a
    location and used for a specific task or for a specified period of time and do
    not require permanent mounting platforms. Mobile monitors are those systems that
    are typically in operation on a platform that is in motion. This standard also
    addresses radiation detection systems that can be carried on a person such as
    backpack-type systems.
